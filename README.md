# Project Title: AI-Insighter

_1 stop platform for 10 stop information_

## Purpose and Background:

This project organizes various AI Models and LLMs into a simple interactive webapp for better user experience.

AI-Insighter removes the need of going on to different website for information about a AI model by having adequate information about a particular model in one place.

## Objectives:

### 1. **Develop a Model Browsing Space**

<p>To create a user-friendly interface where users can easily browse through a catalog of AI models. This space should effectively organize and display models in a way that highlights their features, usage, and other key information. The layout and presentation should enhance user engagement and make it easy to navigate through the available options.</p>

### 2. **Feature a Wall for Highlighted Models**

<p>Implement a dedicated section or "wall" within the application that features selected AI models. These models are to be highlighted based on specific criteria such as popularity, user ratings, or inclusion in a number of favorite lists by developers. The rationale behind featuring each model should be clearly communicated to the users, enhancing transparency and trust in the selection process.</p>

### 3. **Provide Detailed Pages for Individual Models**

<p>Ensure that each AI model available on the platform has a detailed dedicated page. Pop modal should furnish users with comprehensive information about the model, including a thorough description, the model's provider, code snippets for demonstration, and possible use cases. This will enable developers and users to make informed decisions about utilizing these models in their projects. </p>

### 4. **Facilitate Model Information Submission**

<p>Design and implement a submission interface for model providers to upload and share information about their AI models. This space should be intuitive and seamlessly integrate with the existing application architecture, allowing for the straightforward addition of models to the "Explore" space. The process should encourage contributions by simplifying the submission of detailed model descriptions, usage examples, and relevant use cases.</p>
